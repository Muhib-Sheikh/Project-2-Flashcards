## Notes

I faced quite a few challenges during this project:

Finding a topic, using useState correctly (I didn't realize I declared it outside of the Card function for a long time), displaying the cards correctly, using CSS to make the elements appear as I wanted them to, flipping the card while hovering, and I had some minor issues putting the project on GitHub again.

## Notes

The main challenges I faced during this project were:

Making the next and previous buttons maintain the order, making sure everything reset when pressing submit, adding the form/updating the text as you type. The main issue I faced was trying to add the visual feedback after submitting, it took the most time.
